## Features

### Recipe Search

Users can enter a description of what they feel like eating, and TasteAI will generate a list of tailored recipe suggestions. Users can explore
different recipes based on their preferences, and the app will filter out disliked recipes in future recommendations.

### Favorites

Recipes can be added to the user's favorites list for easy access later. The Favorites Page keeps track of all the recipes the user has marked as
favorites, offering a personalized recipe book.

### Dislike and Exclude Recipes

The app allows users to dislike recipes, and those disliked recipes will be excluded from future search results for the same query. The disliked
titles are stored locally and prevent the same recipes from appearing multiple times.

## Technologies Used

### The project incorporates the following technologies:

**React**: A JavaScript library for building the user interface. React powers the component-based architecture of the app.\
**TypeScript**: The app is written in TypeScript, providing static typing to enhance code quality and maintainability.\
**Tailwind CSS**: Tailwind is used for styling the application. It allows for rapid UI development with utility classes.\
**OpenAI GPT-4o mini**: The application uses GPT-4 to generate recipe suggestions based on user input, providing personalized meal ideas.\
**ESLint and Prettier**: These tools ensure consistent code quality and formatting across the project.\
**Husky & lint-staged**: To manage pre-commit hooks and ensure code is properly linted and formatted before being pushed.\
**Vite**: The development server is powered by Vite, providing fast build times and a smooth developer experience.\
**Bun**: Used as the JavaScript runtime, offering improved performance over Node.js for tasks like bundling, transpiling, and package
management, leading to faster development workflows.

## Client Setup

To configure the client and get it running, ensure that your `.env` file contains the necessary environment variables:

`VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY`: Your OpenAI API key for fetching personalized recipe suggestions. For example:

```bash
VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
